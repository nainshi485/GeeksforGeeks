Given a number N and a value K. From the right, set the Kth bit in the binary representation of N. The position of LSB(or last bit) is 0, second last bit is 1 and so on. Also, 0 <= K < X, where X is the number of bits in the binary representation of N.

Input:
First line of input contains a single integer T, which denotes the number of test cases. T test cases follows. First line of each testcase contains two space separated integers N and K.

Output:
For each test case, print the new number after setting the Kth bit of N.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
10 2
15 3

Output:
14
15
